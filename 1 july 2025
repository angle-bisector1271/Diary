2:54 pm

yesterday passed without a note. i had meant to write, but the weight of the day settled thick on my shoulders by the time i returned. an intense weekend. two different conferences had their deadlines on the 30th. i stayed up nearly all night rereading the papers i had already reread, hunting for stray mistakes, vague explanations, incomplete citations, bold assumptions in proofs, anything that might twitch a reviewer’s eyebrow.
most of my summer projects are now taken care of, except for prof t’s, which remains dangerously incomplete, with dim-looking prospects of our ideas working at all.

ever since i wrapped up the old paper with r, i’ve been unsure where to send it. the acvr workshop at iccv seemed promising, and its deadline loomed last night. but i hesitated. couldn’t tell if it was the right home. by 8, the office had hollowed out. the usual quiet. empty chairs. the distant hum of the fan.
somewhere in that quiet, i remembered the ufc match-oliveira vs topuria. it’s the only sport i follow, the only one that gives me that strange, narrow kind of focus. i opened youtube. topuria landed a clean knockout. oliveira was out before he hit the floor. new lightweight champ.
i sat for a while after the fight ended. the silence returned. and with it, the conference question.

i looked up ictai. turns out the deadline’s been extended, july 14. some part of me softened. maybe that’s the one. if i submit prof t’s project too, that would make it two papers in the same conference. or none, if both get rejected. still, it gave me something to hold on to. a shape to the next two weeks. a void filled, however briefly. one last paper left before the curtain falls on undergrad research. after that? not really sure.

i left the office, had dinner on autopilot. retreated to my room, opened j’s messages-he’d worked on prof t’s project while i was buried in the last weekend's deadlines. i tried to read his updates, but the words slipped past me. nothing stayed. i was too tired to understand or even try.
closed my laptop. took a cold shower. turned off the lights. slept with dreams i no longer remember.
