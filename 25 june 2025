1:43 am
two weeks left before i’m back in delhi. supervisor left around 5 today, said he’s out of town till monday. four quiet days ahead. 
left office sometime in the evening, tired from faking work on trading libraries and actually constructing a topological gradient descent method.
came back to my room, opened my laptop, updated the draft research paper, google meet with prof t.  
texting k. k asked if i’d eaten. i hadn’t. said i’d order something. asked k to suggest smth to order. k insisted on ordering for me, without telling me what it was.
an hour later the delivery guy showed up with arabic chicken and pita bread. it was really good.
cowboy bebop popped into my head. opened episode 22 while eating. got pulled into it again, like always. food disappeared before the credits rolled.
cowboy bebop music is still playing. room’s gone quiet. writing this post while staring at half-finished code. i still need to fetch training data for prof t’s project. 
not sure where to find it. maybe i’ll look in the morning. maybe not.
